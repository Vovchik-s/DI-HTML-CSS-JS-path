  POMODORO

  Project Description :
  A hackaton project for advanced timer to help you with concentration and to be in a good mood.
  
  
  
  Why i am intresting in this project ?
  My motivation is pretty simple. Since chilhood i have problems focusing on a task and a simple timer was a lifesaver for me.

  But since YouTube appeared in my life, i started using video like "3-HOUR STUDY WITH ME | 25 min study, 5 min break | Background noise, Rain sounds"
  And my goal to recreate atmospher of those videos
